### Three (four) more interesting transit facts in this data 

### FACT 1 

![](../images/incline.jpg){style="width:50%; box-shadow: -2px 3px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); display: block; margin: auto;"}

In Pittsburgh, PA there is a unique form of uphill rail transit called the [Duquesne Incline](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duquesne_Incline). It offers arguably the most scenic view of Downtown Pittsburgh and the convergence of the city's "Three Rivers." Do tourists largely ride the Duquesne Incline? : 

*from Wikipedia:*

>The incline was intended to carry cargo up and down Mt. Washington 
>in the late 19th century. It later carried passengers, particularly 
>Mt. Washington residents who were tired of walking up the steep footpaths 
>to the top of the bluff. Inclines were being built all over Mt. 
>Washington to serve working-class people who were forced out of the 
> lowlying riverfront by industrial development

I was interested to see if the ridership numbers suggested any traditional transit usage, or if the incline was now primarily used for “transit tourism”.

: Data for yearly ridership of the Pittsburgh Inclined Plane {.striped .hover}


### Conclusion 
The ridership numbers spiking in the summer, along with stark drop off in ridership from December to January, suggest the incline is largely popular with tourists and not used as much by the hill-weary residents of Mt. Washington.

### FACT 2

![](../images/red-state-blue-state.jpg){style="width:50%; box-shadow: -2px 3px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); display: block; margin: auto;"}

As our country remains polarized on so many issues and cultural concern, I was curious if there was an obvious Red vs. Blue divide over transit usage in this country. 

I wanted to see if I could identify any obvious distinctions or division in the use of transit between Red States and Blue States.

: Data for total State Transit Trips {.striped .hover}

### Conclusion 

There does in fact look to be a Red vs. Blue divide over transit usage in this country. While this list is indeed dominated by many **Blue States**, I believe the most convincing evidence for this fact are state rankings #7 - #11. 

Both Florida, Texas and Georgia - *all **Red States*** -  are among the largest states by population in the United States. 

1. Florida Population: **22.4 million**
2. Texas Population: **30.03 million**
3. Georgia Population: **10.9 million** 

However, Oregon and Washingon are neighbors to those 3 large Red states in this ranking of transit use. 

Yet Oregon and Washington - *both **Blue States*** -  are medium-sized states in terms of population counts. 

1. Washington Population **7.786 million**
2. Oregon Population    **4.2 million**

That Oregon and Washinton maintain comparable volumes of transit usage, despite significantly lower populations than large **Red States** like Florida, Texas and Georgia, suggest there is a Red v. Blue divide over transit usage in the United States. 

A better exercise would be to measure transit trips / population to see the per capita number for ridership.

### FACT 3 

![](../images/si_ferry.jpg){style="width:50%; box-shadow: -2px 3px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); display: block; margin: auto;"}


This is interesting : 

```
USAGE |>

  summarize(total_trips = sum(unlinked_passenge_trips),
            total_miles = sum(vehicle_revenue_miles),
            num_ppl_mile = total_trips / total_miles
            ) |>
  arrange(desc(total_trips)) |>
  slice(1:50) |>
  arrange(desc(average_trip)) |>
  print(n = 50)
```


| agency                                  | total_trips    | total_miles  | num_ppl_mile |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| New York City Department of Transportation | 440,538,576    | 4,150,573    | 106          |
| Washington State Ferries                | 502,394,973    | 20,230,767   | 24.8         |
| City and County of San Francisco        | 4,533,445,698  | 583,200,690  | 7.77         |


### Conclusion


This looks to be communicating that Ferries are very efficient vehicles for transporting a lot of people over small distances. Every [SI Ferry carries around ~4,000 people ! ](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/ferrybus/ferry-facts.shtml#:~:text=John%20J.,16%20knots%2C%20and%209%2C000%20horsepower.)

# Task 5: Table Summarization
Create a new table from USAGE that has annual total (sum) UPT and VRM for 2022. This will require use of the group_by, summarize, and filter functions. You will also want to use the year function, to extract a year from the month column.

```
USAGE_2022_ANNUAL <- USAGE |>
  mutate(year = year(month)) |>
  filter(year(month) == 2022) |>
  group_by(year, metro_area, agency, mode, `NTD ID`) |>
  summarize(total_upt = sum(unlinked_passenge_trips, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_vrm = sum(vehicle_revenue_miles, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  select(`NTD ID`, agency, metro_area, mode, total_upt, total_vrm, year) |>
  filter(total_upt > 400000) |>
  ungroup()

USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS <- left_join(USAGE_2022_ANNUAL,

  rename(

    "expenses" = "Expenses",
  ) |>
  select(-"Agency Name") |>
  drop_na() |>
  
print(USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS, n = 5)

Transit use is an unmistakable social, ecological and economical good. It enhances opportunity, reduces pollution and generates wealth through efficient land use. 

As such, I believe the transit agency and mode that provides the most trips is the most efficent system:
