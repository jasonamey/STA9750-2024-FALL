Originating in the proto-Internet era of Usenet groups in the early
1990s, the Internet Movie Database (with its instantly recognizable
acronym: IMDb) has long been an indispensable source of pop culture
information. Movie buffs, film industry professionals, trivia
enthusiasts, and casual web surfers all agree IMDb is the go-to resource
for anyone engaged in the history of motion pictures.

## What's in the box?

### How many green lights have been granted in Hollywood?

The "M" in the moniker obviously denotes "movie" and there are indeed
`131,890` traditional "movies" in IMDb. However, many take a different
interpretations as to what is - and what is not - a "movie" and IMDb
maintains a separate designation for `tvMovie`.

The author contends that the films produced by the premium television
outlet Home Box Office are significant films all-too-often overlooked by
film afficianados and sure enough, HBO films are considered television
films by IMDb :

```         
titleType   primaryTitle            startYear
tvMovie     And the Band Played On  1993

titleType   primaryTitle            startYear
tvMovie     Recount                 2008
  
titleType   primaryTitle            startYear
tvMovie     Conspiracy              2001
```

Not an HBO original, but this `tvMovie` is partially credited for
[ending The Cold
War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_After#Effects_on_policymakers):

```         
titleType   primaryTitle    startYear
tvMovie     The Day After   1983
```

The above are all noteworthy (underrated) films more than deserving to
be considered and counted alongside IMDb's critera for "movie". If we
were to count both `movie` and `tvMovie` we would find `146,915` movie
titles in IMDb.

...Speaking of television, that "M" in IMDb can be something of a
misnomer. IMDb collects data on both film and television too. And within
the database, IMDb doesn't just maintain an entry for every television
series, but actually has a record for each televison season and a record
for every televsion episode. All told there are `29,868` series within
IMDb represented by over `3,012,678` individual episdoes.

If television is collected this extensively in the database, what else
does IMDb collect? What else is in the database?

I'd argue the collection of Video Games will prove increasingly
important as this media form grows in cultural influence. I can
certainly see a future where Video Games are of equal cultural
significance (...if were not at that momemnt already?) as film and TV is
today.

### 110 years old you reach, look as good you will not

IMBb is a unrivaled resource for assessing film history. And by history,
there is actually some capital "H" history in IMDb.

IMDb counts `4` as the oldest `birthYear` for any individual in its
dataset. And not just `4`, there are also `birthYear` values for `46`,
`69`, `70`, `163`, `254`. As far as we know, film production is a \~150
year old technology.

What is going on?

Who was born in year `4`? Year `46`? Year `69`?

``` r
             primaryName
1       Flavius Josephus
2 Publius Vergilius Maro
3                   Ovid
4  Titus Maccius Plautus
5     Lucio Anneo Seneca
6            Cassius Dio
7               Plutarch
8              Suetonius
```

Are you entertained? A fascinating qwirk of IMDb database is that it
credits classical writers and historians for modern film production,
again, proving IMDb is if nothing else an historical resource and begs
the important question?

*Does Zach Snyder share [300](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film))
points with Plutarch?*

But how about someone we know or can identify? Who is eldest creator
still alive in the IMDb database? A seemingly easy way to identify
"oldest creator in IMDb" would be to seek out creators with an `NA` for
`deathYear`.

Unfortunately there are quite a few people IMDb considers living in
their sunset years. IMDb idetifies 2,514 "supercentarians" - individuals
110 years of age or older - who at one time worked the film industry.

The [Gerontology Research Group](https://www.grg-supercentenarians.org/)
rigorously counts "supercentarians" around the world. A supercentarian
is an individual equal-to, or older-than, the age of 110. At current
count, there are approximately \~310 supercentarians in the world.

Clearly there is an issue with the IMDb dataset identifying `2,514`
supercentarians in the film industry. There obviously are a multitude of
deaths unreported in this data.

But, just because you're old and you possibly "one-time-maybe did
something in the film industry", should anyone care? There are millions
of people who throughout their lives have no-doubt been involved in at
least 1 movie production in their lives. Does "old person who once
worked on a forgotten independent movie no-one-saw" really communicate
anything to us?

I posit that anyone who did anything significant in the film industry
would have their `deathYear` duly reported. Therefore, let's re-start
our search and see if we can arrive at a collection of individuals
"significant enough in the film industry" to warrant our interest and
attention.

Let's first try to identify "significant film productions" in our data.

I'm going to use the measure of: "if this film had a lot of people
working on it, it no doubt cost a lot of money and was of notable
interest to some studio or production company." So I'm going to count
the number of crew on a film and look for a threshold for top
produciton.

Here are the quantiles for the crew counts:

```         
10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90% 100% 
10   14   16   18   19   20   21   22   24   65 
```

`90%` of all productions have `24+` or more crew numbers working on
them. I'm going to identify any person "significant" in the films
industry as someone who has worked on `20+` such productions. Sorted on
`number_of_big_productions` worked on, sure enough this yields useful
information:

| Name              | Birth Year | number_of_big_productions | age | deathYear |
|-------------------|------------|---------------------------|-----|-----------|
| Seth MacFarlane   | 1973       | 2505                      | 51  | 0         |
| Dee Bradley Baker | 1962       | 2311                      | 62  | 0         |
| Dan Castellaneta  | 1957       | 2242                      | 67  | 0         |
| Hank Azaria       | 1964       | 2191                      | 60  | 0         |
| Harry Shearer     | 1943       | 2162                      | 81  | 0         |
| Eric Stuart       | 1967       | 2043                      | 57  | 0         |

<!-- The TV series Happy Days (1974-1984) gives us the common idiom “jump the shark”. The phrase comes from a controversial fifth season episode (aired in 1977) in which a lead character literally jumped over a shark on water skis. Idiomatically, it is used to refer to the moment when a once-great show becomes ridiculous and rapidly looses quality. -->

### Jump the Shark with Happy Days

Wikipedia suggests the famous "jumping the shark" episode from Happy
Days happened episode `3` season `5`.

After we identify all the episdoes of Happy Days in our IMDb data we
create two sets of data filtered around the pivot point of season `5`
episode `3` : **before shark** and **after shark**.

Performing calculations on these two sets we see:

``` r
> mean(happy_days_episodes_ratings_before_shark$averageRating)
[1] 7.484404

> mean(happy_days_episodes_after_shark$averageRating)
[1] 6.878571
```

Happy Days did, in fact, jump its own proverbial shark.

## Beyond the Spotlight

In an attempt to single out noteworthy films, I created a statistical
quantification of a movie's positioning by evaluating both its IMDb
rating and the number of IMDb users who voted on the film. This approach
aims to capture both the **quality** (via the rating) and the
**popularity** (via the number of votes) of the film.

To achieve this, I calculated **Z-scores** for both the film's rating
and its number of votes, which measure how far each value deviates from
the mean in terms of standard deviations. I then transformed these
Z-scores into **cumulative probabilities** using the `pnorm()` function,
which maps the Z-scores to probabilities between 0 and 1, effectively
scaling the values from 1 to 100. To emphasize quality, I assigned a
weight of 2 to the film's rating in the final combined score.

$$
\text{Total Score} = 2 \cdot \Phi(\text{rating score}) + \Phi(\text{votes score})
$$

**Here are the results**:

| primaryTitle                                      | startYear | total_score |
|---------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|

: Top 30 Movies by Total Score {.striped .hover}

Movie Box Office is reported in several popular widely available outlets
and box office data is the type of low-stakes metric
that Internet-curated resources like Kaggle are uniquely suited for
providing. To check the box office returns of the Total Score
calculation, the [Kaggle Movies
Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)
was used for box office under the variable `revenue`.

However, films can span several decades and box office figures are not
as useless unless the numbers are controlled in constant dollars. To correct for this the following variable was added to our data:

$\text{Box Office Adjusted in 2024 Dollars} = \text{Box Office} \times \frac{\text{Consumer Price Index 2024}}{\text{Consumer Price Index Historical Year}}$

It's always fascinating to view films ranked by adjust box office figures :

While The Shawshank Redemption looks like a 
"failure" here, it famously more than made up for its lackluster Box Office returns in [DVD sales, cable television licensing and streaming agreements](https://www.slashfilm.com/1670564/the-shawshank-redemption-box-office-flop-30-years-ago/):

>"It's an incredible moneymaking asset that continues to resonate with viewers," said Jeff Baker, 
>the former executive vice president and general manager of Warner Bros. Home Entertainment 
>theatrical catalog, in that Wall Street Journal piece. "Shawshank" is one of the best performers 
>in the studio's library, in no small part thanks to strong DVD/Blu-ray sales, not to mention streaming

Does `Film Score` work in reverse? Does it correctly identify "bad" movies? 

Filtering for films that are in the top `80%` of movies voted on, and sorting on `film_score` yields some truly terrible films:

How about examining a prominent director? Is there any direcor more prominent than Steven Spielberg? 
Querying for `film_score`, we find Steven Spielberg's films score : 

`[1] 94.67846`

Even including *Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)*, *The BFG (2016)*, and *Always (1989)* Steven Spielberg films collectively average in the top `95%` of all films. `film_score` correctly identifies the most prominent talent in the industry.

How does another director compare to Steven Spielberg? 

Performing an analysis on famous low-budget king Ed Wood finds his films score:  

`[1] 87.15062`

This number is in line with someone who has lesser-quality films than Spielberg, but have become beloved cult-favorites. 

To identify a `film_score` cut-off, I exported the data into a spread sheet for ease of viewing. I filtered for larger box office films so I could identify the films and used the cut-off of `$50,000,000`. I scrolled through the films assessing the quality of the neighboring films until I started to identify a good number of forgettable films. I waited until I reached the point of "I really don't see many good films below this number" and I identified the classic horror film *The Hills Have Eyes (1977)* as a fitting cut-off point. 

I'm going to settle on `78.99` as the `film_score` threshold dividing "good movie" from "bad movie":

When we say "movie" we often think of "what is opening this Friday" and
with it: "what film will win the weekend box office?"

If we look at the Kaggle Movie Dataset, we see

Seminal podcaster Bill Simmon’s (a man [paid 200 million dollars to
podcast](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/spotify-acquires-the-ringer-196-million-cash-bill-simmons-1203502471/))
has argued on his #1 film podcast [The
Re-Watchables](https://www.theringer.com/the-rewatchables) that the
Oscars should be awarded 5 years after a film’s release. Time-and-time
again, the Academy of Motion Picture and Science awards its most
prestigious award to a questionable film that years after leaves
audiences scratching their heads over the decision. This is likely due
to the impossibilty of fully evaluating a work of art until time finally
settles and properly establishes a film's legacy. All-too-often:
out-sized marketing budgets, capricious cultural fads or unrecognized
behind-the-camera politics are what grants a film the industry's most
coveted honor.

Do the Right Thing (1989), Saving Private Ryan (1997), Brokeback
Mountain (2005) and The Social Network (2010) are all classic examples
of the essential films of their respective years, egregiously
unrecognized by the academy.

Thus, Simmons argues we should establish "The 5 Year Oscars." The awards
should not be awarded until 5 years prior to a film's initial release.

(Television netowrk ABC, longtime broadcast home to the Oscars
broadcast, would likely not be thrilled with the decision to not embrace
movie-stars-of-the-moment in the ceremony.)

I'd like to extend this analysis to all films. If we ignore all film
reviews for a 5 year window, will we be left be able to recongize a
higher caliber or higher quality film? If we were to put film reviews
into a "5 year freezer", will it impact their rankings and perception?

Most importantly, will it hurt the score of objectively terrible movie
Crash (2005)?

This analysis is not possible with just IMDb data. For this analysis I
will need to bring in the data from review site [Movie
Lens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

Movie Lens offers a record for every review from each contributors - all
with a time-stamp for when the review was submitted. Movie Lens first
review was issued in `1995`. Thus, we can only properly evaluate films
from `2000 - 2019` (5 years after `1995` and 5 years prior to `2024`)
