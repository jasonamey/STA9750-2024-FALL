Originating in the proto-Internet era of Usenet groups in the early 1990s, the Internet Movie Database (with its instantly recognizable acronym: IMDb) has long been an indispensable source of pop culture information. Movie buffs, film industry professionals, trivia enthusiasts, and casual web surfers all agree IMDb is the go-to resource for anyone engaged in the history of motion pictures. 

## What's in the box?

### How many green lights have been granted in Hollywood? 

The "M" in the moniker obviously denotes "movie" and there are indeed `131,890` traditional "movies" in IMDb. However, many take a different interpretations as to what is - and what is not - a "movie" and IMDb maintains a separate designation for `tvMovie`. 

The author contends that the films produced by the premium television outlet Home Box Office are significant films all-too-often overlooked by film afficianados and sure enough, HBO films are considered television films by IMDb : 

```
titleType   primaryTitle            startYear
tvMovie     And the Band Played On  1993

titleType   primaryTitle            startYear
tvMovie     Recount                 2008
  
titleType   primaryTitle            startYear
tvMovie     Conspiracy              2001
```

Not an HBO original, but this `tvMovie` is partially credited for [ending The Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_After#Effects_on_policymakers):

```
titleType   primaryTitle    startYear
tvMovie     The Day After   1983
```

The above are all noteworthy (underrated) films more than deserving to be considered and counted alongside IMDb's critera for "movie". If we were to count both `movie` and `tvMovie` we would find `146,915` movie titles in IMDb. 

...Speaking of television, that "M" in IMDb can be something of a misnomer. IMDb collects data on both film and television too.  And within the database, IMDb doesn't just maintain an entry for every television series, but actually has a record for each televison season and a record for every televsion episode. All told there are `29,868` series within IMDb represented by over `3,012,678` individual episdoes.

If television is collected this extensively in the database, what else does IMDb collect? What else is in the database?

I'd argue the collection of Video Games will prove increasingly important as this media form grows in cultural influence. I can certainly see a future where Video Games are of equal cultural significance (...if were not at that momemnt already?) as film and TV is today.

### 110 years old you reach, look as good you will not

IMBb is a unrivaled resource for assessing film history. And by history, there is actually some capital "H" history in IMDb.  

IMDb counts `4` as the oldest `birthYear` for any individual in its dataset. And not just `4`, there are also `birthYear` values for `46`, `69`, `70`, `163`, `254`. As far as we know, film production is a ~150 year old technology. 

What is going on? 

Who was born in year `4`? Year `46`? Year `69`? 

```r
             primaryName
1       Flavius Josephus
2 Publius Vergilius Maro
3                   Ovid
4  Titus Maccius Plautus
5     Lucio Anneo Seneca
6            Cassius Dio
7               Plutarch
8              Suetonius
```

Are you entertained? A fascinating qwirk of IMDb database is that it credits classical writers and historians for modern film production, again, proving IMDb is if nothing else an historical resource and begs the important question? 

*Does Zach Snyder share [300](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)) points with Plutarch?* 

But how about someone we know or can identify? Who is eldest creator still alive in the IMDb database? A seemingly easy way to identify "oldest creator in IMDb" would be to seek out creators with an `NA` for `deathYear`. 

Unfortunately there are quite a few people IMDb considers living in their sunset years. IMDb idetifies 2,514 "supercentarians" - individuals 110 years of age or older - who at one time worked the film industry.

The [Gerontology Research Group](https://www.grg-supercentenarians.org/) rigorously counts "supercentarians" around the world. A supercentarian is an individual equal-to, or older-than, the age of 110. At current count, there are approximately ~310 supercentarians in the world. 

Clearly there is an issue with the IMDb dataset identifying `2,514` supercentarians in the film industry. There obviously are a multitude of deaths unreported in this data. 

But, just because you're old and you possibly "one-time-maybe did something in the film industry", should anyone care? There are millions of people who throughout their lives have no-doubt been involved in at least 1 movie production in their lives. Does "old person who once worked on a forgotten independent movie no-one-saw" really communicate anything to us?  

I posit that anyone who did anything significant in the film industry would have their `deathYear` duly reported. Therefore, let's re-start our search and see if we can arrive at a collection of individuals "significant enough in the film industry" to warrant our interest and attention. 

Let's first try to identify "significant film productions" in our data. 

I'm going to use the measure of: "if this film had a lot of people working on it, it no doubt cost a lot of money and was of notable interest to some studio or production company." So I'm going to count the number of crew on a film and look for a threshold for top produciton. 

Here are the quantiles for the crew counts: 

```
10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90% 100% 
10   14   16   18   19   20   21   22   24   65 
```

`90%` of all productions have `24+` or more crew numbers working on them. I'm going to identify any person "significant" in the films industry as someone who has worked on `20+` such productions. Sorted on `number_of_big_productions` worked on, sure enough this yields useful information: 

| primaryName        | birthYear | number_of_big_productions | age  | deathYear |
|--------------------|-----------|---------------------------|------|-----------|
| Seth MacFarlane     | 1973      | 2505                      | 51   | 0         |
| Dee Bradley Baker   | 1962      | 2311                      | 62   | 0         |
| Dan Castellaneta    | 1957      | 2242                      | 67   | 0         |

| Harry Shearer       | 1943      | 2162                      | 81   | 0         |
| Eric Stuart         | 1967      | 2043                      | 57   | 0         |
