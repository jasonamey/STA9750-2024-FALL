## Is there a relationship between streets and home values?

## When streets minimize traffic incidents, is there a corresponding increase in property values?

## Project Question: 
### *Do streets with less traffic and traffic violence increase property values?*

## There is no singular identification of NYC street transformations

## NYC does identify singular Vision Zero improvemments

## Media Coverage as a signal for “significant traffic calming project”

## Identifying significant traffic calming projects in local media

## With block and lot numbers we can identify tax assessments

## Identify comparable, neighboring streets by traffic flows

## (again) ...with block and lot numbers we can identify tax assessments

## Challenge: Geocoding 

*Once we've identified areas of interest, how do we go from?*

street -> latitude and longitude 

latitude and longitude -> block, lot number

identifying a corridor of a street? 

correctly identifying a collection of properties? 

*How do we do this in code?*


## Tax Lot Selector

## Data sets we will use 

**New York City Department of Finance.** *Property Assessment Roll Archives.* NYC Department of Finance. 

**City of New York.** *Automated Traffic Volume Counts.* NYC Open Data. 



## Data sets we may use


**City of New York.** *VZV Street Improvement Projects - SIPs Corridor.* NYC Open Data. 

**Westlaw.** (2024, October 8). Search results for “bike lane" in New York Post articles. Westlaw.

**Westlaw.** (2024, October 8). Search results for “bike lane" in New York Daily News articles. Westlaw.

**New York City Department of City Planning.** *NYC Tax Lot Selector.*


## Challenges for project 
1. Can we make geographic connections among our data with code? 

2. What statistical test should we use to test for significance in tax assessment changes? 
3. How do we effectively and efficiently work with large files? (The tax assessment files are ~1GB)

4. Is there enough media coverage to identify significant traffic calming projects? 

5. How many traffic calmed corridors should we focus on? 


## Thank You!
