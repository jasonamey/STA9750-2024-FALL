## What makes a neighborhood expensive in NYC? 


**Location:** Proximity to Manhattan often increases prices.

**Transportation:** Better access to subways, buses, and major roads raises desirability.

**Amenities:** Access to parks, schools, dining, shopping, and cultural attractions.

**Crime:** Safer neighborhoods tend to be more expensive.

**Status:** Historical prestige, architecture, and celebrity residents can elevate prices


## Is there a relationship between streets and home values?

## Project Question: 
### *Do streets with less traffic and traffic violence increase property values?*


## When streets minimize traffic incidents, is there a corresponding increase in property values?

## There is no singular identification of NYC street transformations

## Media Coverage as a signal for “significant traffic calming project”

## Parse text from html and rank tokens in search of street names

## Need to identify block and lot numbers on streets

## With block and lot numbers we can identify tax assessments

## Identify comparable, neighboring streets by traffic flows

## ...attempting to control for these influences:

## Questions for project 
1. Can we make geographic connections among our data with code? For instance: can we find traffic calmed corridors, and then identify neighboring properties by block and lot number? Can we isolate street regions bounded by cross streets? 

2. What statistical test should we use to test for significance in tax assessment changes? 
3. How do we effectively and efficiently work with large files? (The tax assessment files are ~1GB)

4. Is there enough media coverage to identify significant traffic calming projects? 

5. How many traffic calmed corridors should we focus on?
