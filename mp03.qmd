# The Electoral College Dilemma: Tradition, Tension, and the Future of American Democracy

*by Jason Amey*

The **Electoral College** is one of the most misunderstood components of the American political system. Rooted in the Constitutional principle of federalism, the **Electoral College** is designed to balance power by ensuring that both individual states and the overall population have a voice in electing the nation’s leader. 

This approach emphasizes the importance of state sovereignty, reflecting the framers’ intent to respect the rights and influence of each state within a diverse and expansive union. This system requires presidential candidates to seek support across a wide geographic range, ensuring that the voices of smaller or less populous states are not dominated by larger population centers.

Recently the **Electoral College** has become an increasingly contentious, particularly as modern elections have seen candidates win the presidency without winning the popular vote. This disconnect in recent years has raised questions about the system's fairness and the extent to which it reflects the will of the people. 

For many American voters, it remains unjust that a candidate who secures the majority of votes nationally can still lose the presidency. This reality has engendered disenfranchisement among voters who feel their voices are increasingly insignificant in choosing a President.

A segment of this disenchantment stems from the difficulty in changing our constitutional system. Changing the **Electoral College** is a complex task, not only because it would require a constitutional amendment, but also because many constituencies currently benefit from this arrangement. States that hold a disproportionate influence under the **Electoral College** system are unlikely to support a departure from the **Electoral College** beacuse it would reduce their electoral power and political significance. 

Amending the Constitution demands broad consensus—a nearly impossible level of national agreement that is exceedingly rare in today’s polarized political climate. Thus, while many Americans express a desire to reform or eliminate the **Electoral College**, the practical and political barriers to doing so are aguably insurmountable.

The ongoing use of the **Electoral College**, despite its oft-misalignment with the popular vote, presents a significant challenge to the perceived responsiveness of elected leaders to the public’s democratic wishes. When candidates who do not enjoy the majority’s support are elevated to the presidency, it can strain the public’s trust in our political system. This tension between majority rule and the structure of the **Electoral College** poses serious questions for the future of American democracy, as it risks diminishing the public’s faith in the electoral process and the legitimacy of its political leaders.

---

To explore the dynamics of the Electoral College, a data analysis was conducted using electoral data from the **MIT Election Data and Science Lab**, which provides detailed voting records across **U.S. House** elections from `1976` to `2022`.^[MIT Election Data and Science Lab, 2017, "U.S. House 1976–2022", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/IG0UN2, *Harvard Dataverse*, V13, UNF:6
/IVldA== [fileUNF]] This dataset offers insights into historical voting patterns and party performance at the district level, essential for understanding shifts in electoral influence over time. This data was with congressional shapefiles from **UCLA’s PoliSci Mapping Center**^[CD Maps, “The Database of Congressional Historical Shape Files,” https://cdmaps.polisci.ucla.edu/] and the **U.S. Census Bureau**’s **TIGER/Line** files.^[U.S. Census Bureau, "TIGER/Line Shapefiles," https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html] These resources enable a comprehensive analysis of the **Electoral** College system, highlighting shifts in population and the impact districting commands over electoral outcomes.

## How has the Electoral College changed since 1976? 

The past `40` years have seen dramatic demographic and economic shifts in the **United States**, with the "**Sun Belt**" region experiencing significant population growth. Factors such as warm climates, a lower cost of living and growing job opportunities have all contributed to this population transformation. Cities like **Phoenix**, **Dallas**, **Houston**, and **Atlanta** have expanded rapidly, becoming economic powerhouses that attract internal migration.^[Glaeser, E. L., & Tobio, K. (2008). The rise of the **Sun Belt**. Southern Economic Journal, 74(3), 609-643.] This trend has boosted the political influence of the **Sun Belt** states, particularly in presidential elections, as their share of the **Electoral College** votes has grown in proportion to their population increases.

In contrast, the **Northeast** and **Rust Belt** states have faced steady population declines. The **Rust Belt** continues to grapple with the economic fallout from the decline in manufacturing^[Nelson, P. B. (2005). Migration and the regional redistribution of nonearnings income in the United States: Metropolitan and nonmetropolitan perspectives from 1975 to 2000. Environment and Planning A, 37(9), 1613-1636.]. The **Northeast**, once a densely populated region driving much of the nation's political power, has also seen a slower growth rate due to higher costs of living and an unwelcome, cooler climate. States like **New York**, **Ohio**, **Pennsylvania**, and **Michigan** have all lost congressional seats^[Mooney, A. (n.d.). How states losing House seats decide which districts are cut. Mooney.house.gov. Retrieved November 13, 2024, from https://mooney.house.gov/how-states-losing-house-seats-decide-which-districts-are-cut/]—and, by extension, **Electoral College** votes—in the face of a southward shift in national demographics.

The impact on the **Electoral College** reflects these changes, as the **Sun Belt**’s increasing population has translated into greater political clout. Every ten years, the **U.S. Census** triggers a reapportionment of congressional seats, redistributing the `435` seats in the **House of Representatives**—and thus **Electoral College** votes—based on population changes.

This dynamic remains relevant, as commentary last week, following **Donald Trump**’s decisive electoral win, prompted influential conservative commentator **Ben Shapiro** to highlight the continued decline in influence of the **Rust Belt** and the **American Northeast**, historically strongholds of Democratic power.^[Shapiro, B. [@benshapiro]. (2024, 11, 6). "Hey Democrats, I have some more unfortunate news for you. Here's what the electoral map looks like.. " Tweet. X. https://x.com/benshapiro/status/1854210993645297694]:

Despite the **Sun Belt**'s rising population and the corresponding increase in **Electoral College** votes, a paradox exists: many of these rapidly growing **Sun Belt** states lack the political clout associated with “**swing states**.”^[Harvard Kennedy School Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation. (n.d.). The Electoral College and our broken presidential election system. Harvard Kennedy School. Retrieved November 13, 2024, from https://ash.harvard.edu/articles/the-electoral-college-and-our-broken-presidential-election-system/] 

In the **Electoral College**, political influence often hinges not only on a state’s population, but on its competitiveness in presidential elections. States like **Texas** and **Florida**, though gaining in electoral votes, are often reliably partisan (both are heavily **Republican**), which can diminish the attention they receive compared to smaller yet more unpredictable states like **Pennsylvania** or **Wisconsin**. 

This “**swing state**” phenomenon means that candidates prioritize states with narrower margins, where votes are likelier to tip the election, giving smaller, competitive states a unique power in the electoral process that even populous states in the **Sun Belt** do not always share.

## The Fusion Phenomenon

**Fusion voting**, also known as cross-endorsement, is an electoral practice that allows a candidate to appear on the ballot under multiple party lines, thereby consolidating votes from different political bases. This approach enables third parties to endorse a major-party candidate, allowing voters to support a candidate's platform through the values or policies associated with a smaller, often more ideologically-focused party. In practice, fusion voting can increase a candidate's visibility while empowering smaller parties to influence major-party agendas.^[Protect Democracy. (n.d.). Fusion voting explained. Protect Democracy. Retrieved November 12, 2024, from https://protectdemocracy.org/work/fusion-voting-explained/]

In **New York City**, fusion voting originally began in the `1930`'s as a strategy to challenge **Tammany Hall**. Since then, many fusion-enabled parties have become important fixtures in **New York** area politics. For one, **The Working Families Party** has frequently endorsed progressive Democratic candidates while giving voters an alternative way to support candidates who align with specific labor and social equity issues. Likewise, **The Conservative Party** line gives voters a direct voice to amplify their commitment to limited government and social conservatism. All told, the fusion approach has been unique in **New York City**’s local elections, shaping policy conversations and reinforcing the presence of alternative political values within a largely two-party system.^[Electoral fusion in the United States. (n.d.). In Wikipedia. Retrieved November 11, 2024, from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fusion_in_the_United_States]

What follows is a unique table of instances where a candidate only won their election with 3rd party support.  The `Highest %` column charts the losing candidate's highest total of votes from their main policitical party - but it not being enough to exceed the winning candidate's fusion totals.

## House vs. Presidential Candidate Support in Recent U.S Elections


![](images/mp-03/party-score.png)

These scores represent the standardized differences in voter support between **Democratic** and **Republican** candidates in House versus Presidential elections for each election year. This examination represents whether in a given state and year a party's House candidates received a higher or lower percentage of votes than the party's Presidential candidate, indicating voter preferences that may diverge between congressional and national races. The standardized score highlights years with especially strong or weak alignment between House and Presidential support. Positive scores indicate years when House candidates outperformed Presidential candidates, while negative scores suggest the opposite.

## High Positive Scores for Democrats (1984, 1980, 1992): ##

The **Democratic Party** shows substantial positive discrepancies in years like `1984`, `1980`, and `1992`, suggesting that Democratic House candidates outperformed the Democratic Presidential candidate by a notable margin in these years. `1980` and `1984` reflect the transformative political strength of Ronald Reagan, arguably one of the most consequential Presidential figures of the last `50` years.^[Smith, Robert C. "Ronald Reagan, Donald Trump, and the Future of the Republican Party and Conservatism in America." American Political Thought 10.2 (2021): 283-289.] In `1992`, a strong third-party showing by **Ross Perot** inevitably influenced voting patterns, with many voters splitting their votes between Perot and their local Democratic House Representatives.

[^1]: Smith, Robert C. "Ronald Reagan, Donald Trump, and the future of the Republican party and conservatism in America." American Political Thought 10.2 (2021): 283-289.

## High Negative Scores for Republicans (1988, 1984, 1976): ##

In `1988`, `1984`, and `1976`, `Republicans` have significant negative scores, suggesting that in these years, Republican House candidates underperformed relative to the Presidential candidate. This might indicate that the Presidential candidate was particularly appealing, drawing votes that House candidates could not capture as effectively.

This trend suggests that in certain election years, voters may have been inclined toward a Republican President but were more mixed in their support for **Republicans** in the House, as was the case in `1988` and `1984` years when the GOP ran strong candidates atop their tickets. The `1976` results are likely a reflection of broader voter disenchantment with the **Republican Party** post-Watergate in the ensuing years and the need to re-build their national stature among voters. 

There is no research to support this, but there is psycho-speculation that the American voter ultimately has a subconscious preference for a "**strong daddy**" figure in its national executive. The "**strong daddy**" platform would be the politics of robust defense spending and nation-wide discipline handed out in the form of cutting popular social spending. This thesis would explain why **Republicans** in **Congress** often under-perform the Presidential candidate at the top of the ticket.

## Low Discrepancy Years (Near Zero Scores): ##

Years like `2004` (Democrat), `2000` (Republican), and `2012` (Republican) have scores close to zero, indicating minimal discrepancies between the public’s preference for **President** and the **House** within those years.
In such years, voter alignment between Presidential and House races was more consistent, reflecting lower levels of split-ticket voting or greater alignment in perceived candidate appeal and party policies across both levels. These years most likely signaled the rise of growing polarization of the American electorate as seen in recent elections. 

## Recent Years (2008–2020): ##

In recent years, such as `2008`, `2016`, and `2020`, both parties show relatively low scores, suggesting less discrepancy in voter preferences between the House and Presidential candidates. This trend reflects growing political polarization, with fewer voters splitting their votes across parties. The increased partisan consistency among voters has led to a decline in split-ticket voting, a phenomenon that has been well-documented in studies on electoral polarization.^[Abramowitz, A. I. (2022). The Polarized American Electorate: The Rise of Partisan-Ideological Consistency and Its Consequences. Political Science Quarterly, 137(4), 645-674.]

## Differing Means of Allocating Electoral College Votes

The **Electoral College** has long been debated for its undemocratic nature as it can allow a candidate to win the presidency without securing the popular vote. In doing so, the **Electoral College** effectively amplifies the influence of smaller or swing states over larger, non-competitive states. This occurs due to the **State-Wide Winner-Take-All** method, where the candidate who wins the majority of votes in a state receives all of that state’s electoral votes, making individual votes in less competitive states less influential.

But states are not compelled to use the **State-Wide Winner-Take-All** method as the **United States Constitution** allows states to decide for themselves how they allocate their electoral votes. 

What follows is a brief overview of the different electoral vote allocation strategies and their political implications...

**State-Wide Winner-Take-All:**

Currently used by most states, this approach awards all electoral votes to the candidate with the most votes in a state. While it simplifies outcomes, it can marginalize voters in states where one party has a strong majority, as votes for the minority party have no impact on the **Electoral College** outcome. This strategy focuses campaign efforts on swing states, leaving “safe” states largely ignored.

**District-Wide Winner-Take-All + State-Wide “At Large” Votes:**

This approach allocates one electoral vote per congressional district, awarded to the candidate who wins the district, with two additional votes (representing the **Senate** seats) awarded to the statewide winner. Adopted by **Maine** and **Nebraska**, it reflects more local preferences but may amplify the impact of gerrymandered districts, which can skew results within a state.

**State-Wide Proportional:**

In this model, electoral votes are allocated proportionally based on the statewide vote. This approach provides a more representative outcome for each state, as candidates receive electoral votes in line with their actual support. 

**National Proportional:**

Here, electoral votes are allocated based on the candidates' national popular vote percentages. This model reflects the popular vote while maintaining the structure of the **Electoral College**.

## The Presidential Elections of 2000 and 2016

The `2000` and `2016` elections offer compelling cases for examining competing methods of distributing electoral votes. In both instances, the **Electoral College** outcome diverged from the popular vote, with the presidential candidates who secured the majority of electoral votes not winning the national popular vote. These elections highlight the potential discrepancies within the **Electoral College** system and can shed light on whether alternative approaches might better align electoral outcomes with the popular will.

Analyzing these stess-testing elections arguably offers the best insight into how different allocation methods could impact future presidential races and the broader democratic process.

## Election of 2000: George W. Bush v. Al Gore
The `2000` presidential election served as a stark reminder of the **Electoral College**'s pivotal role in determining the presidency, a mechanism many Americans were unfamiliar with until then. The race between **George W. Bush** and **Al Gore** hinged on a razor-thin vote margin in **Florida**, leading to a weeks-long recount and intense media scrutiny of obscure ballot-counting procedures including introducing the country to the infamous "**hanging chad**." 

Ultimately the **Supreme Court** intervened in the recount, issuing a decision in *Bush v. Gore* that halted the **Florida** recount and awarded the state’s electoral votes to **Bush**. In a break from traditional jurisprudence, the Court explicitly declared that its ruling was intended solely for this case and was not meant to set legal precedent. 

While this contentious election spurred calls to reform or abolish the **Electoral College** no significant changes materialized, and the system remained unchanged.

## The Election of 2016: Donald J. Trump v. Hillary Clinton

The `2016` election is regarded as one of the most consequential in recent memory as it's impact on American politics and society is still felt today. Widely expected to end in an easy victory for **Hillary Clinton**, the election shocked political experts and the nation at large when **Donald Trump** defied predictions and won. 

**Trump**'s unconventional, "gonzo" approach to politics upended traditional campaign norms and is seen as ushering in a new brand of political conservatism—one that marked a significant departure from the policies and style of traditional Republican politics. This shift has shaped the direction of the **Republican Party** and redefined the political landscape, solidifying the `2016` election as an undeniably transformative moment in **U.S. History**.

**Donald Trump**'s confrontational and unorthodox style as president only intensified public scrutiny of the Electoral College as he had won in `2016` despite losing the popular vote. His tumultuous administration brought scrutiny upon the **U.S. Constitution** and renewed calls for reform or even abolition of the **Electoral College**. 

However, despite this heightened debate surrounding the **Trump Presidency**, there was no meaningful progress toward changing the **Electoral College**. Consequently, the **Electoral College** remains unchanged even as public criticism grew increasingly pronounced during the **Trump Aministration**.

## Finndings


The **Electoral College** system inherently disadvantages densely concentrated urban populations due to geographic sorting, where large numbers of voters in cities are “wasted” under the current allocation methods. This effect is especially pronounced in the **State-Wide Winner-Take-All** and **District-Wide Winner-Take-All + At-Large** systems, where urban votes are overshadowed by more spread-out rural and suburban voters. Even with a **State-Wide Proportional** approach, the dispersed nature of electoral votes dilutes the power of high-population centers.^[Pearson-Merkowitz, S., & Lang, C. (2016). The geographic polarization of American voters. The Geography Teacher, 13(3), 112-117.]

This dynamic reflects the original pastoral leanings of certain **Founding Fathers**, who were wary of urban centers and their concentrated political influence. Many founders idealized a nation of independent, rural landowners and saw the **Electoral College** as a mechanism to balance the interests of these pastoral areas against growing urban centers.^[Rodden, J. A. (2019). Why cities lose: The deep roots of the urban-rural political divide. Basic Books.] Consequently, modern calls for Electoral College reform often stem from this persistent tension between rural and urban representation.

Critics of the Electoral College, such as historian **George C. Edwards III**, argue that this system inevitably introduces a significant "**democratic deficit**" by allowing a candidate to win the presidency without securing the popular vote. **Edwards** suggests that this mechanism distorts democratic representation, disproportionately empowering certain states and demographic groups at the expense of others, and thus subverting the principle of equal representation.^[Edwards, G. C. (2004). Why the electoral college is bad for America. Yale University Press.]

These findings are in line with the thoughts of [**Robert A. Dahl**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Dahl), widely regarded as one of the United States' preeminent authorities on democratic theory and the American Constitution.

In *How Democratic Is the American Constitution?*  **Dahl** critically examines the Electoral College and its democratic shortcomings. He too recounts the `2000` election, where a candidate with fewer popular votes won, and traces this anomaly to the original confusion and compromises of the Framers. They established the Electoral College out of desperation after rejecting other methods, prioritizing insulation from popular choice and concern over "cabal and corruption."^[Dahl, R. A. (2001). How democratic is the American Constitution? New Haven, Yale University Press.]

As such, the **Electoral College** is deeply rooted in an anti-democratic framework. Built to balance regional influence rather than to represent the popular will, the **Electoral College** was again, crafted with significant limitations to prevent it from reflecting a true **"one person, one vote"** standard. Its mission makes it impossible to align with the democratic values most champion today.

In contrast, modern American political culture is firmly grounded in the principle of equal representation, where each vote should carry equal weight. Most Americans believe strongly in **"one person, one vote"** and would find it jarring, even offensive, for any politician to openly assert that some votes should count more than others. 

Yet by supporting the **Electoral College**, we tacitly accept this inequality, promoting the illusion that it’s anything other than an outdated system that distorts minority political power.

There exists a deep disatisfaction with the **Electoral College** among the American public^[Pew Research Center. (2024, September 25). Majority of Americans continue to favor moving away from Electoral College. Pew Research Center. Retrieved November 12, 2024, from https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/09/25/majority-of-americans-continue-to-favor-moving-away-from-electoral-college/]: 
![](images/mp-03/pew-research.png){style="width:60%; border: 1px solid black; display: block; margin: 10px auto;"}

As such, strong public support exists for centering **"one person, one vote"** into the **U.S. Political System** and its methods for selecting the **President**.

If we summarize our findings, there's one system that consistly rewards the **Popular Vote Winner** the `50%` electoral college vote threshold needed to win the presidency: 

![](images/mp-03/2000-electoral-systems.png){style="width:80%; border: 1px solid black; display: block; margin: 10px auto;"}

![](images/mp-03/2016-electoral-systems.png){style="width:80%; border: 1px solid black; display: block; margin: 10px auto;"}
Given these findings, it's the stark purple shading on the **National Proportional** maps above that best reflect the most equitable spirit of **"one person, one vote,"** and thus highlight how popular will could be represented more faithfully while maintaing our current system under the **U.S. Constitution**. If the **Electoral College** must be preserved, such a proportional approach would align more closely with our democratic values and national political culture, offering a way forward that respects the ideal of equal voter influence.

As such, if were to keep the **Electoral College**, we should adopt the **National Proportion** method for allocating electoral votes and the delegates who chose our nation's chief executive, **The President of the United States**.
